Divorce Rate Among USA Astronauts

The goal with this project was to see if Astronauts due to a stressful job had a higher divorce rate. I took all astronauts and used 3 predictors: time in space, number of flights, and children.
I tried to build models to accurately predict which astronauts would get divorced based on the predictors. I used several different model types. Linear, Logistic, LDA,QDA. 
All proved that astronauts are more likely to stay together. There was a very slight but positive connection between married people and time in space.
